## V1.1

### Added:
 - You're in Grave Danger
 - The Twilight Forest
 - Quartz Elevator
 - Applied Energistics 2
 - Bosses of Mass Destruction
 - Create Crafts & Additions
 - Inventory Sorting

### Removed:
 - Witherborn Origins

The Witherborn Origin causes a massive spike in the RAM usage of a server, potentially doubling the amount of RAM the server is using, possible because the Witherborn has an AOE effect that the server is always calculating. This leads to servers running consistently 40 ticks or further behind. May not be an issue in single-player but in an SMP setting the Witherborn Origin is not viable for performance.

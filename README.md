# Friendos Origins SMP

Using CurseForge is a pain in the ass so I'm switching it up.
The only file you need from here is the .zip file.
You will also need:
 - [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/), either from the Minecraft website or from the Microsoft Store
 - [CurseForge](https://download.curseforge.com)
 - [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) - Not sure if you actually do but better safe than sorry
 - To know how much RAM your PC or laptop has so you can allocate an appropriate amount to Minecraft

## Modpack Setup Guide

Because this isn't going directly through the CurseForge service you need to put in extra effort.

### RAM

If you don't already know how much RAM you have:
1. Press `Ctrl+Chift+Esc` to open Task Manager
2. Click the button in the bottom left that says 'More Details'. if the button says 'Fewer Details' then ignore
3. Go to __Performance__ > __Memory__
4. Your total available memory should be displayed in the top right corner of the window. Remember the number or leave the window open.

If you want more RAM for free then you can Google __Swap Files__ and figure them out yourself.
Ideally, you want to be able to dedicate at least 4GB of RAM to a _modded_ Minecraft instance, and no more than 50% of your total RAM (unless you have a metric shitton of RAM).
If you can't allocate 4GB of RAM to Minecraft it's not a problem but the game will probably be a bit laggy.


### Minecraft

Minecraft needs to be installed, and a version of it needs to be run.
As the current pack is 1.18.2 I would say to run an installation of that version, but running the latest should work too.
Once the instance has launched to the Main Menu you can exit the game

### CurseForge

CurseForge is the modpack manager for you to keep your modpacks organised, assuming you have more than just this one, and away from the vanilla installation.
Once the program is installed and launched:
1. You may need to create an account and login. It should work even if you don't but you might have to.
2. Once you've either read or ignored the startup tours, you should be presented with a __Choose a Game__ page. Choose Minecraft. If you haven't launched a Minecraft instance from the Minecraft launcher yet them it won't be available as an option.
3. In the bottom left corner click __Settings__ > __Game Specific__ > __Minecraft__
4. Scroll down to __Allocated Memory__ and drag the slider to whatever amount you feel is right. The slider is presented in MB, where 1024MB = 1GB, so to get my suggested 4GB drag the slider to 4096MB.
5. Close the page.
6. Click __Create Custom Profile__ in the top right corner of the minecraft tab.
7. Click __import__ a previously created profile.
8. Navigate to wherever you saved the .zip file from this page to, probably your Downloads folder.
9. Click on the .zip file and click open.
 - The file may have downloaded as a .zip inside a .zip, in which case extract the first .zip but not the second
10. Once the pack is ready, play it.

If you're planning on playing on or running an SMP server then the URL/IP address should be providedd by your server admin or hosting service.
